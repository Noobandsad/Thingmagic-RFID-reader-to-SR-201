# Thingmagic-RFID-reader-to-SR-201
My project is to scan RFID tag and switch the Relays on SR-201 circuit. 
Language: C#
Device: Thingmagic RFID reader Plus (not really sure)
Software: Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

What i have in hand: 
Codes from mercuryapi-1.35.2.72
A bunch of quickguides from Jadak company that does not help.

I have a small understanding of C language only and am clueless on what I am doing.
I do not know where to start and which code to change. If anybody has a backgraound on working with Thingmagic RFID reader and codes please help me.
